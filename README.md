Hello! Welcome to the frontend app for What to Wear!

This app allows the user to select a city and get the weather for that city.
It also suggests an outfit for the user to wear based on that weather. The user can
also edit the outfits for each city. For proof of concept, I seeded the database with realistic information from cities and gave each city a set outfit.

My goal for this app is to one day add the Open Weather API to get real time weather
and then allow the user to generate a database of outfits that will be suited for that weather.

The backend API is on my GitHub repo at https://github.com/m-gamao/What_to_Wear_Backend.git

Thanks for stopping by!
